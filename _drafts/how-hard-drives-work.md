As computer users, we are accustomed to storing data to retrieve it later in the future. Today there are many ways to do this. If you take a photo on your cell phone, it's going to be saved into the phones internal `flash memory` (or an external flash card). If you have a modern computer it's likely that you have an `Solid State Drive (SSD)`. It's also possible to save your data in the "`cloud`". So, why focus on Hard drives?

`Hard Disk Drives (HDD)` have been a reliable way to store data since the 1950's. Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) have HDD offerings that are cheaper than the SSD alternatives. As of today, if you want to buy a 5TB HDD, you would have to pay around $100 USD; if you want to buy 5TB SSD you would have to pay around $500 USD. For this reason HDDs are still widely used.

## Hardware

If you buy an HDD, you will get a rectangular box made of metal:

This metal box is designed to protect the moving parts on the inside, which are the ones actually doing data writting and reading.

If we open the box we'll be able to see the disk:
