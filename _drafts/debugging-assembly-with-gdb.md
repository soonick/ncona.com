I wrote a couple of articles about assembly in the last weeks, and in order to understand what I was doing, I thought it would be useful to take a look at the contents of memory and registers to confirm my understand was correct. I looked around, and found that GDB can help with this.

I wrote an [introductory article to GDB](/2018/02/introduction-to-gdb/) a few months ago that you can look at to get the basics. This article is going to build on top of it.
