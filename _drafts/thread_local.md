Storage specifiers in C++

Variable declarations in C++ consist of multiple parts: typedef specifier, function specifier, friend specifier, constexpr specifier, storage specifier and type specifier. In this article I'm going to talk about the different storage specifiers: static, extern and thread_local.

The storage specifier combined with the scope in which the variable is defined determine its lifecycle.
