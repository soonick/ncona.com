Hello Visitor,  

My name is Adrian and this is my blog. I like computers and enjoy learning about them. Whenever I learn something new I try to write about it.

It is very likely that I'll make mistakes in my posts, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Questions are also welcome, but I might not have the time or knowledge to answer all of them.

If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at [**my LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriananconanovelo)
